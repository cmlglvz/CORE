Evolutionary analysis by Maximum Likelihood method 
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Kimura 2-parameter model [1]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates [3] is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [3]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [3]. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4 categories (+G, parameter = 0.4016)). This analysis involved 70 nucleotide sequences. There were a total of 372 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [2]
