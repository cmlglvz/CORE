Evolutionary analysis by Maximum Likelihood method 
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model [1]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-30236.33) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Tamura-Nei model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4 categories (+G, parameter = 0.6976)). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 28.62% sites). This analysis involved 139 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. There were a total of 409 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [2]
